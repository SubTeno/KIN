      A collaboration between chef Dinah Blackburn and interior designer Lee
      Rainwater, Kin is where East Austin returns to the Old West. Styled like
      the saloons of yore, here you can sip cactus wine and enjoy the robust
      taste of farm-to-table American fare without the frills.

            “From the sawdust on the ground to the mounted taxidermy on the walls, Hunter is where modern Texans go to relive the turn of the 19th century. Their dishes are simple, hearty, fresh, and all-around delicious.”

            “By focusing purely on food and ambience, Hunter provides the authenticity of the Old West without the costumes and playacting of a themed restaurant. You can bring your cowboy boots if you want, but the humble and relaxed atmosphere asks that you come as you are.”

            “Ms. Blackburn has surprised us with her ability to turn pioneer staples into gourmet delights. Her signature cocktails are not merely couched in nostalgia, but are a genuine rebirth of western saloon classics.”

            “Good food and cocktails are one thing, but this place had me sold with its twenty beers on tap. From your regular joes to your craft brew snobs, Hunter has something for everyone and brings the saloon life back to Texas. All they need now is a pianola.”
